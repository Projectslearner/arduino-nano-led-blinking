### LED Blinking with Arduino Nano

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use an Arduino Nano to blink an LED on and off at intervals of 0.5 seconds. Blinking LEDs are often used as status indicators in various electronic projects.

#### Components Needed and Block Diagram

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **LED**
3. **220Ω Resistor**
4. **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram



#### Circuit Setup

1. **Arduino Nano to LED:**
   - Connect the anode (long leg) of the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino Nano through a 220Ω resistor.
   - Connect the cathode (short leg) of the LED to the GND pin on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the LED and resistor to the Arduino Nano as described above and shown in the circuit diagram.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect your Arduino Nano to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, observe the LED blinking on and off at intervals of 0.5 seconds.

#### Applications

- **Status Indicators:** Use blinking LEDs to indicate various states or conditions in your projects.
- **Visual Feedback:** Blinking LEDs provide visual feedback, making them useful in user interfaces or notifications.

#### Notes

- Ensure correct orientation and connection of the LED and resistor to prevent damage.
- Adjust the delay values in the code to change the blinking frequency of the LED.
